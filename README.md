# BCACTF 1 2019 Write-ups
So this is my first live CTF. Usually I do CTFLearn and picoCTF which always online and doesn't have time limit, but now I did the first live one. I found this CTF by accident because I rarely open CTFtime.org to see any upcoming CTFs. And then there was this CTF, only 2 hours left from the beginning of the competition. Without thinking I registered myself and joined the competition.

There will be several challenges that I would like to make a write-up for because it's interesting enough to explain. It's not going to be all challenges.
